- Action Execution: Instruct the phone agent to perform specific tasks on the connected device based on the processed command.
- Feedback Display: Present the agent's feedback report to the user, clearly stating the outcomes and any errors encountered during task execution. Use a tool that can parse information.
- Real-time Chatbot Interface: Provide a real-time chatbot interface for seamless interaction with the agent, displaying both user input and agent responses.
- Configuration Persistence: Save and persist user configurations, such as API keys, to ensure automatic connection in subsequent sessions.

- Accent color: Deep purple (#483D8B) for buttons, highlights, and important UI elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern and clean aesthetic that ensures readability.
- Use minimalist, consistent icons with a thin stroke weight to maintain a clean and unobtrusive design.
- Left sidebar for configurations and a wide main area for the chatbot, mimicking the Google AI Studio layout for familiarity and ease of use.
- Employ a 'minimal but not simplistic' design philosophy, focusing on usability and clear information hierarchy.
